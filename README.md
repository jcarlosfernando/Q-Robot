# Q-Robot

Q-Robot is a versatile open-source Quadruped Robot (Q-Robot) developed with affordable electronic devices, with structural parts printed in PLA from 3D printers, integrating Robot Operating System (ROS) and Wi-Fi connection. The project aims to present a model with significantly reduced cost, to use only standard components and straightforward fabrication, aiming its use for educational purposes.

Inspired by the famous fourlegged robot from Boston Dynamics, Spot Mini. The proposed model is an adaptation of a model developed by Kim Deok-Yeon, named Spot Micro and
