# Q-Robot

Q-Robot is a versatile open-source Quadruped Robot developed with affordable electronic devices, with structural parts printed in PLA from 3D printers, integrating Robot Operating System (ROS) and Wi-Fi connection. The project aims to present a model with significantly reduced cost, to use only standard components and straightforward fabrication, aiming its use for educational purposes.

Inspired by the famous fourlegged robot from Boston Dynamics, Spot Mini, Q-Robot is an adaptation of a model developed by Kim Deok-Yeon, named Spot Micro.

Q-Robot uses ROS packages [rosserial](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial) and [CHAMP](https://github.com/chvmp/champ#champ-) to works.
